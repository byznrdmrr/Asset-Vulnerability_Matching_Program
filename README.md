# asset-vulnerability_matching_program
The project has been developed to be used in the Sakarya University Cyber ​​Security Laboratory. It is a desktop program that presents the asset information coming from critical infrastructure systems with the vulnerabilities in line with the os / firmware and model information using the Java programming language. Within the scope of the project, it was provided by web scraping from NIST's NVD vulnerability database with the JSOUP library for vulnerability matching and presented to the user using the swing GUI widget toolkit. The asset information is kept in the mysql database.

The address done web scraping: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search
